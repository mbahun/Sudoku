# Sudoku
Solve and create Sudoku games.

## The problem
Represent any Sudoku problem by using OOP. Representation must allow creation of (solvable) problems, finding at least one solution to Sudoku problem and changing the size of Sudoku grid (2x2, 3x3 – standard Sudoku, 4x4). 

## The solution
Windows/Linux console application (C++) able to solve Sudoku problems of different sizes. Solver is simple – trying all meaningful combinations and stopping when first solution is found. Focus is not on the solving algorithm itself but on the object-oriented representation of the problem.
